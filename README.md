# The best group ever maybe password guesser
What our project does is a password guesser. This password guesser is to give self awarness to people's pronouns and that not everyone goes by gender rules. This project is an example of how to be respectful and polite.

This project uses if statements and fun variables to create a politacly correct guesser, we started with the button and from their we put a click function in JavaScript. The end. sorry the password is "What is your pronoun?".

If we had more time, we could design the site.
